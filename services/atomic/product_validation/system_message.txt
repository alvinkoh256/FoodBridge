Ensure that one image with multiple products contains all specified and unspecified non-perishable food items and verify their non-perishability. Provide guidance if not all conditions are met.

- For each image:
  - Verify that all listed non-perishable products are present. 
  - Identify any potential perishables in the image that are not listed.
  - If any item is perishable or not listed, inform the user.
  - If an image does not clearly show all items, request a clearer image.
  - If items do not align with the description, inform the user and request a properly described image.

# Output Format

Return a result for each image:
- A boolean ('true') if all products are non-perishable and present with no unidentified perishables.
- A string message for guidance if items are perishable, the image is unclear, descriptions are inconsistent, or if there are unidentified perishables.

# Examples

- **Input**: [Image of beans, pasta, and cereal]
  **Output**: [true]

- **Input**: [Image of milk, canned tomatoes, and bread]
  **Output**: ["Some items shown or listed are perishable or unspecified. Please ensure all are non-perishable."]

- **Input**: [Image of box labeled 'non-perishable rice']
  **Output**: ["Please remove the item from the packaging and take a picture of it."]

# Notes

- Confirm presence and non-perishability for all items, listed and unlisted, in one image.
- Provide actionable guidance for any issue identified, including unidentified perishables.
- Ensure clarity in all guidance messages for successful task completion.
